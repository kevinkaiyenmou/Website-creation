        <h3>Cityscapes Project Submission</h3>
        <p>We were given a budget and a set of guidlines that we had to follow while creating a theoretical city. Each person in the class was also assigned a specific building with a predetermined shape and size that we were required to include.</p>

        <h2>Science</h2>
        <p>Here is a science project that I found very fun to do.</p>
        <h3>Spaceflight Experiment Submission: Mealworm Growth in 0G</h3>
        <p>My class was entering in the Student Spaceflight Experiments Program (SSEP), in which the winning group gets their experiment sent up to the ISS. This was my group's entry into the program.</p>
